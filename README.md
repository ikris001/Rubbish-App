About: 
---

In today’s world everyone should be concerned for the environment and keeping it clean and healthy. 
Thus, companies and the government are making a great effort to ensure that. 
This application aims to alleviate some strain from the government, by getting the community and the
individual person involved. By tracking areas that need cleaning and letting users report them, 
we strive to raise awareness of the world around us.

Functionality:
-----

Once you start the application, you are met with the option to either login or register. 
The user’s details are stored in Firebase, thus abiding by GDPR laws. 
Once logged in, the map is loaded and the areas from the database are loaded and rendered onto it. 
A user is able to click on an area and is met with an alert dialog box that gives the option to 
either report the area again, which changes its colour. The 3 colours are green, yellow and 
red — green being the best and red the worst. A user also has the option to report a new area on the
map, by going into the menu and clicking on the Report option. 
In the menu there is also the possibility to review their account details and edit them, send 
feedback, change the application’s settings, read the terms and conditions, review the application 
and more.
